# Fruits Collecting Game

## Description
A simple and fun arcade-style game where colorful fruits fall from the top of the screen, and you control a basket at the bottom to catch them. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the basket. Catch as many fruits as possible to increase your score, but be careful—missing fruits will cost you lives! The game becomes more challenging as fruits fall faster and spawn more frequently. Try to beat your high score!

## How to Play
- Use the **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys to move the basket.
- Catch falling fruits to increase your score.
- Missing a fruit costs you one life.
- The game ends when you lose all 3 lives.
